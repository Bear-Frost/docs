# Pointer

The Pointer sensor responds to [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events).  It is one of the default sensors used by the [DndContext](../context-provider/) provider if none are defined.

> Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch \(such as one or more fingers\).
>
> The pointer is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates. Having a single event model for pointers can simplify creating Web sites and applications and provide a good user experience regardless of the user's hardware.

### Activator

The pointer activator is the `onPointerDown` event handler. The Pointer sensor is initialized if the pointer event was triggered by the [primary pointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events#Determining_the_Primary_Pointer).

For mouse there is only one pointer, so it will always be the primary pointer. For touch input, a pointer is considered primary if the user touched the screen when there were no other active touches. For pen and stylus input, a pointer is considered primary if the user's pen initially contacted the screen when there were no other active pens contacting the screen.

### Activation constraints

The Pointer sensor two activation constraints.

* Distance constraint
* Delay constraint

These activation constraints are mutually exclusive and may not be used simultaneously. 

#### Distance

The distance constraint subscribes to the following interface:

```typescript
interface DistanceConstraint {
  distance: number;
}
```

The `distance` property represents the distance, in _pixels_, by which the pointer needs to be moved before a drag start event is emitted.

#### Delay

The delay constraint subscribe to the following interface:

```typescript
interface DelayConstraint {
  delay: number;
  tolerance: number;
}
```

The `delay` property represents the duration, in _milliseconds_, that a draggable item needs to be held by the primary pointer for before a drag start event is emitted. 

The `tolerance` property represents the distance, in _pixels_, of motion that is tolerated before the drag operation is aborted. If the pointer is moved during the delay duration and the tolerance is set to zero, the drag operation will be immediately aborted. If a higher tolerance is set, for example, a tolerance of `5` pixels, the operation will only be aborted if the pointer is moved by more than 5 pixels during the delay.

This property is particularly useful for touch input, where some tolerance should be accounted for when using a delay constraint.
