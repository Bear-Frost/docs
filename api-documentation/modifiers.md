# Modifiers

Modifiers let you dynamically modify the movement coordinates that are detected by sensors. They can be used for a wide range of use cases, for example:

* Restricting motion to a single axis
* Restricting motion to the draggable node container's bounding rectangle 
* Restricting motion to the draggable node's scroll container bounding rectangle
* Applying resistance or clamping the motion
