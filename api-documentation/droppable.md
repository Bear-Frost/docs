# Droppable

![](../.gitbook/assets/droppable-large.svg)

Use the `useDroppable` hook to set up DOM nodes as droppable targets that draggable elements can be dropped over. 

**dnd kit** isn't opinionated about how you should structure your app. At minimum though, you need to be able to pass a `ref` to the `setNodeRef` function that is returned by the `useDroppable` hook. Use whatever DOM element is most semantic in the context of your app.

```jsx
import {useDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/core';


function Droppable() {
  const {setNodeRef} = useDroppable({
    id: 'unique-id',
  });
  
  return (
    <div ref={setNodeRef}>
      /* Render whatever you like within */
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Hook API â€“ `useDraggable`

### Arguments

```typescript
interface UseDroppableArguments {
  id: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  data?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

Set the `disabled` argument to `true` if you'd like to temporarily disable a `droppable` 

The `data` argument is for advanced use-cases where you may need access to additional data about the droppable element in custom sensors or presets. For example, if you were building a sortable preset, you could use the `data` attribute to store the index of the droppable element within a sortable list.  

### Return value

```typescript
{
  clientRect: ClientRect;
  isOver: boolean;
  node: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
  over: {id: UniqueIdentifier} | null;
  setNodeRef(element: HTMLElement | null): void;
}
```

Use the `isOver` boolean returned by the `useDroppable` hook to change the appearance or content displayed when a `draggable` element is dragged over your droppable container. 

If you'd like to change the appearance of the droppable in response to a draggable being dragged over a different droppable container, check whether the `over` value is defined. Depending on your use-case, you can also read the `id` of the other droppable that the draggable item to make changes to the render output of your droppable component.
