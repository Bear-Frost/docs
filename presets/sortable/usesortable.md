# useSortable

The `useSortable` hook is an abstraction that composes the [`useDroppable`](../../api-documentation/droppable.md) and [`useDraggable`](../../api-documentation/draggable/) hooks.

To function properly, the `useSortable` hook needs to be used within a descendant of a [`SortableContext`](sortable-context.md) provider higher up in the tree.
